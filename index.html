  <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Redfish Labs</h3>

<p>This site is a place where the Redfish team can store, work on, and distribute information and resources associated with
  our more cutting-edge efforts.  The technology presented here may not be ready for general release, but we're happy to 
  share our work-in-progress with our interested customers, and provide early access to our more adventurous testers.</p>

  <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iDVM Web Bluetooth</h3>

<p>We're proud of our iDVM iOS and Android apps, and think they're great at meeting the general needs of many different
  users of our iDVM multimeters.  But we also know that the mobile apps can't meet <em>all</em> of the particular
  software requirements of our various users.  Specifically, the mobile apps can't run on several platforms,
  such as desktop and laptop PCs, and many users would like to collect measurements in a business-specific 
  format that our general record-to-database mechanism doesn't allow.</p>

<p>To address these issues, we're implementing the mechanisms for iDVM meters to communicate over 
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web">Web Bluetooth</a>.
  Web Bluetooth is a technology that Google is building into the Chrome browser that will enable the browser,
  and the pages it loads, to communicate over Bluetooth to hardware devices.  This means that you can write your own
  web pages or web apps, incorporating your own business logic, and include multimeter measurements and calculations
  right into the logic.  You can also write your own multimeter UI and run it on any platform that can run the latest
  version of Chrome, including Mac, Linux, Chrome-OS or Android.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository 
  to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, 
  a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers 
  without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
