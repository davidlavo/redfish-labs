<p>This site is a place where the Redfish team can store, work on, and distribute information and resources associated with
  our more cutting-edge efforts.  The technology presented here may not be ready for general release, but we're happy to 
  share our work-in-progress with our interested customers, and provide early access to our more adventurous testers.</p>

<a id="idvm-web-bluetooth" class="anchor" href="#idvm-web-bluetooth" aria-hidden="true">
  <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iDVM Web Bluetooth</h3>

<p>We're proud of our iDVM iOS and Android apps, and think they're great at meeting the general needs of many different
  users of our iDVM multimeters.  But we also know that the mobile apps can't meet <em>all</em> of the particular
  software requirements of our various users.  Specifically, the mobile apps can't run on several platforms,
  such as desktop and laptop PCs, and many users would like to collect measurements in a business-specific 
  format that our general record-to-database mechanism doesn't allow.</p>

<p>To address these issues, we're implementing the ability for iDVM meters to communicate over 
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web">Web&nbsp;Bluetooth</a>.
  Web&nbsp;Bluetooth is a technology that Google is building into the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a> 
  that will enable the browser, and the pages it loads, to communicate over Bluetooth to hardware devices.  
  This means that you can write your own web pages or web apps, incorporating your own business logic, and include 
  multimeter measurements and calculations right into the logic.  You can also write your own multimeter UI and run it 
  on any platform that can run the latest version of 
  <a href="https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md">Chrome, 
  including Mac, Linux, Chrome-OS or Android</a>.
</p>

<p>There will soon be a separate page of this site dedicated to iDVM Web&nbsp;Bluetooth with detailed instructions and links
  to resources, but for now if you want to try it out you can try loading 
  <a href="https://labs.redfishinstruments.com/idvm/web-bluetooth/idvm_example.html">this example form</a> 
  into an updated version of Chrome running on Mac, Linux, Android or Chrome-OS.

<a id="ios-html-panels" class="anchor" href="#ios-html-panels" aria-hidden="true">
  <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iOS HTML Panels</h3>

<p>Many customers have told us that they wished they could add custom data entry forms to our mobile apps,
  so that they could capture measurements from their meters, but also include their own business logic or workflows.
  We obviously can't include specific forms for each such use case, however, in a general-purpose app like iDVM2.</p>
          
<p>The non-iOS solution to this problem, as mentioned <a href="#idvm-web-bluetooth">above</a>, is the 
  <a href="#idvm-web-bluetooth">iDVM&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Bluetooth</a> mechanism we're implementing for the Chrome web browser.  
  However, due to browser limitations on the iOS platform, it is unlikely that Google will ever provide  
  Web&nbsp;Bluetooth functionality in Chrome on iOS.</p>

<p>As a solution on iOS, then, we're considering adding another panel to the iDVM2 iOS app that can contain user-supplied
  HTML, CSS and Javascript, and would also receive meter measurement and state-change notifications from the main app.  
  The idea is similar to the iDVM&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Bluetooth idea, since the panel is just a browser window within the app,
  but the delivery of measurements happens in a slightly different manner.</p>
          
<p>We've implemented a demonstration of the &ldquo;HTML Panel&rdquo; idea in the current version of the iDVM2 beta release,
  available through the TestFlight program.  If you're interested in trying this out, please let us know and we'll tell
  you how to participate in TestFlight and get the beta app.</p>

<a id="idvm-bluetooth-spec" class="anchor" href="#idvm-bluetooth-spec" aria-hidden="true">
  <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iDVM Bluetooth Specification</h3>

<p>We encourage developers to add support for the iDVM multimeter to their apps.  The iDVM multimeter is a 
  standard Bluetooth-LE device that publishes its own custom Measurement profile, as well as standard Device
  Information and Battery Profiles.  If you are used to writing apps that communicate with Bluetooth-LE hardware,
  the iDVM Bluetooth-LE Specification document should give you all the information you need to write your own
  meter interface.</p>
